# AiP-project-2021-HappySails

This game was made by a student of HSE MIEM, Borozdna M D

It is written on Python version 3.10.1, and uses pygame library.

Please note, that this project contains a function which was oroginally published by techwithtim : https://github.com/techwithtim/Pygame-Car-Racer/blob/main/tutorial1-code/main.py

This project has not made it to be a complete game. Currently this is just a simple sailing simulator.

To control the boat use a/d for steering and w/s for the mainsheet that controls the sail.
